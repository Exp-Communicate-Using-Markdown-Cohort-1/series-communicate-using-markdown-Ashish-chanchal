# Welcome to "Communicate using Markdown"! üëã

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight syntax for communicating on GitHub. You can format text to add headings, lists, bold, italics, tables, and many other stylings. You can use Markdown in most places around GitHub:

- Comments in issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Files with the .md or .markdown extension
- Sharing snippets of text in Gists

## What is a header?
A header is a larger bit of text at the beginning of a section. There are six sizes.

### Example
# This is an `<h1>` header, which is the largest
## This is an `<h2>` header
###### This is an `<h6>` header, which is the smallest

### How it looks
This is an <h1> header, which is the largest
This is an <h2> header
This is an <h6> header, which is the smallest

‚å®Ô∏è **Activity: Edit your file with headers**
1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
2. Open the pull requests tab.
3. Click New pull request, for the branches to compare, select base: main and compare: start-markdown.
4. Click Create pull request.
5. In this pull request, go to the Files changed tab. We made an empty file index.md for you.
6. Select Edit file from the three dotted ... menu in the upper right corner of the file view on index.md.
7. On the Edit file tab, add a #, followed by a space, before any content you like to make it an H1 Header. You can add more headers, using one to six # characters followed by a space.
8. Above your new content, click Preview.
9. Type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.
10. Select Commit directly to the start-markdown branch.
11. Click Commit changes.
12. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

## Step 2: Add an image
Great job adding headers to the file ‚ú®

Let's add an image. Include descriptive text in the square brackets. This text is read aloud for people using screen readers. It's also shown at times when your image doesn't display, such as when there's a poor connection. You can see the syntax for images below:

### Example
![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)

### How it looks
Image of Yaktocat

‚å®Ô∏è **Activity: Adding an image**
1. As you did before, edit the index.md file in this pull request.
2. In the file, add the correct Markdown for your image of choice. Don't forget to include alt-text!
3. Use the Preview tab to check your Markdown formatting.
4. Commit your changes.
5. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

## Step 3: Add a code example

In addition to code blocks, some code blocks should be rendered differently depending on the language, such as JavaScript or command-line text.

### Example
\```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
\```

### How it looks
\```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
\```

‚å®Ô∏è **Activity: Adding a code example**
1. As you did before, edit the file in this pull request.
2. In the file, add the correct Markdown for a code example of your choice.
3. Use the Preview tab to check your Markdown formatting.
4. Commit your changes.
5. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

## Step 4: Make a task list
Great job adding a code example to the file ü•≥

What is a task list? A task list creates checkboxes to check off. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests. If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. The syntax for task lists is very specific. Be sure to include the spaces where required, or else they won't render.

### Example
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete

### How it looks
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete

‚å®Ô∏è **Activity: Add a task list**
1. GitHub Actions went ahead and made a branch for you. So you'll need to add to the file we've created in the branch, and we will check your work as you work through this course!
2. Return to your pull request.
3. Use Markdown to create a task list. Here is an example:

   - [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
   - [ ] Outline my portfolio
   - [ ] Introduce myself to the world

4. Remember, a task list starts with the syntax - [ ] and then the task list item. The formatting is specific!
5. Use the Preview tab to check your Markdown formatting.
6. Commit the changes to the file.
7. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

## Step 5: Merge your pull request
Great job adding a task list to the file ‚ù§Ô∏è

You can now merge your pull request!

‚å®Ô∏è **Activity: Merge your pull request**
1. Under your repository name, click Pull requests.
2. In the ‚ÄúPull Requests‚Äù list, click the pull request you‚Äôd like to merge.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the pull request.
4. Click Merge pull request.
5. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.
